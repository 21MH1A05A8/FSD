	<p>Children are born perfect at being themselves, but what if that natural ease and delight are taken away from you by forces beyond your control? In her latest writing, Chaos into Beauty, Katherine Davis narrates how she survived diminishment and found not just solace but profound strength in the act of creating and recreating herself. She regains voice and language, music and spirit, discovering that out of pain and loss, a terrible beauty can be born. In art and in exercise, she finds room to grow and to be, more than a witness, an embodiment of joy.</p>
